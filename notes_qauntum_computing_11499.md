## **1. Introduction to Quantum Computing**  
Quantum computing leverages principles of quantum mechanics to process information in ways that classical computers cannot. Unlike classical bits (0 or 1), **qubits** can exist in **superposition** (both 0 and 1 simultaneously) and **entanglement** (correlated qubits that share states regardless of distance). This enables quantum computers to perform complex calculations exponentially faster for certain problems. The field is rooted in quantum theory, with foundational contributions from scientists like Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, and Richard Feynman.  

**Key Principles**:  
- **Superposition**: Qubits can be in multiple states until measured.  
- **Entanglement**: Qubits can be linked such that the state of one instantly influences the other.  
- **Quantum Gates**: Operations (e.g., Hadamard, CNOT) manipulate qubits, with reversible operations critical to quantum algorithms.  

**Historical Context**:  
- The 5th Solvay Conference (1927) marked the birth of quantum theory, with Nobel laureates like Feynman and Schrödinger.  
- Google’s 2019 quantum supremacy claim (solving a 5,000-qubit problem in 200 seconds) demonstrated quantum advantage.

## **2. Fundamental Concepts**  
### **2.1 Qubits and Superposition**  
- **Qubit Definition**: A qubit is a quantum bit that can be in a state of |0⟩, |1⟩, or both (superposition).  
- **Superposition Example**: A qubit can represent both 0 and 1 simultaneously, enabling parallel processing.  
- **Measurement**: When measured, a qubit collapses to a definite state (0 or 1).  

### **2.2 Entanglement**  
- **Entangled Qubits**: Qubits can be linked such that the state of one instantly influences the other, even at a distance.  
- **Example**: In a Bell pair, measuring one qubit determines the state of the other.  

### **2.3 Quantum Gates**  
- **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Creates superposition.  
- **CNOT Gate**: Entangles qubits.  
- **Pauli Gates**: Flip qubit states (X, Y, Z).  

### **2.4 Quantum Algorithms**  
- **Shor’s Algorithm**: Factorizes large numbers exponentially faster than classical methods, threatening RSA encryption.  
- **Grover’s Algorithm**: Searches unsorted databases quadratically faster than classical algorithms.  
- **Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT)**: Enables efficient analysis of periodic functions, critical for algorithms like Shor’s.

## **3. Quantum Gates and Circuits**  
Quantum circuits are sequences of quantum gates that perform computations. Key components include:
